PVS Studio is an essential tool for developers working with C, C++, C#, or Java. It helps you find and fix bugs and security issues in your code before they become big problems. With its powerful static code analysis, PVS Studio checks your code thoroughly and highlights any potential errors, including common mistakes like typos and copy-paste errors.

The main value of static analysis is in its regular use so that errors are identified and fixed at the earliest stages. There is no point in wasting 50 hours looking for a bug that could be found with static analysis. So, let’s point out that again, the main idea of static analysis is not to find one hidden bug on the day before the release, but to fix dozens of bugs day by day.

## Features of PVS Studio:

Quick start in Windows

PVS-Studio can integrate into Visual Studio development environment 2010-2017. If you use this IDE, then most likely you will just have to go to the menu of the PVS-Studio plugin and choose “Check Current Project”.

Often, it can be a more complicated process, and you will need to integrate PVS-Studio into a build system, even an exotic one. The topic of integration is too broad to describe here. You can find all the information in the detailed documentation.

One more point to notice – PVS-Studio for Windows and Linux has special utilities, that gather information about the compiler launches. These tools allow doing a quick analysis of a project that gets compiled in any possible way. You can quickly try out the analyzer abilities, without wasting time on its integration with makefile or a build script.
